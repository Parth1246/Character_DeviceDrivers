After registering the devie one canrun below command

cat /proc/device | grep <driver_name>

so if it confirms that your device driver is registered and it can be used to connect device drvier and kernel over device number then you need to make device file runnig below command

sudo mknod /dev/<device_driver_name> <device_driver_type> <MAJOR_NUMBER> <MINOR_NUMBER>

device_driver_type = c for character

later you can check by runnign below command that your file is made or not
ls /dev/<device_driver_name> -al

Now we will write a c program that will open and close the device file to see kernel lock there.

in that test file, took one int variable which will return some value, it will try to open the file name fro reading only (O_RDONLY) if ti will throw -1 then the file was not accessible or not loaded at the moment of execution.

so please change the permission by running the below command

sudo chmod 666 /dev/<driver_name>

now one can run the file (gcc file.c)
./a.out

The logs are as given below
